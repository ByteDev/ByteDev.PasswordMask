# ByteDev.PasswordMask

Small windows application to help selecting the certain characters from a given password.  Application requires .NET Framework 4.6.2.

## Why?

A number of websites require the user to type in say the 1st, 3rd and 6th character from their password.  When the password is long and random this can be a pain to find out often resulting in the user pasting the password into notepad and then counting along.  

This application helps speed up the process of selecting the particular numbered characters.
